### Sprites that I will never use, take them and do whatever
Kind of tired of mojang/microsoft's eula changing all of the time, effectively nuking projects that I've been working on for the past few years.
Made a bunch of sprites over all this time, and since I will likely never use them, you guys can use them instead.
Do whatever you want.
